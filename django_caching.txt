Django's Caching framework allows you to store data so that
it can be quickly retrieved for future requests, reducing the load
on the database and speeding up responses times.

1. Types of caching in django:

--> File-Based caching: stores cache data in files on the server.
--> in-memory Caching (e.g: Memcached, Redis): stores cache in memory for fast access.
--> Database Caching: Stores Cache data in a database table.
--> Custom Backends: Create your own caching Backend.



1) Memcached

--> Memcached is an entirely memory based cache server. It is used by sited such as Facebook and wikipedia to reduce database access
and dramatically increase site performance.


--> Memcached runs as a daemon and is alloted a specified amount of RAM. All it does is provide
a fast interface for adding, retrieving and deleting data in the cache. All data is stored directly
in memory, so there's no overhead of database or filesystem usage.

install Memcached
pip install pymemcache
